# hi, whydenyscry is here.

i don't really do chaotic dynamics, but you can trace my passion for the beautiful, so i present my gallery of chaotic and hyperchaotic attractors in three repositories:
- [Dynamics of Chaotic 3D Attractors: Part 1](https://github.com/whydenyscry/Dynamics-of-Chaotic-Attractors-Part-1)
- [Dynamics of Chaotic 3D Attractors: Part 2](https://github.com/whydenyscry/Dynamics-of-Chaotic-Attractors-Part-2)
- [Dynamics Of Hyperchaotic High-Dimensional Attractors](https://github.com/whydenyscry/Dynamics-of-Hyperchaotic-Attractors)

and i can't avoid sharing the relevant repositories:
- [General Algorithm of The Explicit Rungeâ€”Kutta Method](https://github.com/whydenyscry/General-algorithm-of-the-explicit-Runge-Kutta-method)
- [Lyapunov Exponents](https://github.com/whydenyscry/Lyapunov-Exponents)
